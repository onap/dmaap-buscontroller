DMaaP Bus Controller API
=======================

Data Movement as a Platform (DMaaP) Bus Controller provides an API for other ONAP infrastructure components to provision DMaaP resources.
A typical DMaaP resource is a Data Router Feed or a Message Router Topic, and their associated publishers and subscribers.
Other infrastucture resources such as DR Nodes and MR Clusters are also provisioned through this API.

### Build Instructions for a Continuous Integration environment using Jenkins

When this component is included in a Continuous Integration environment, such as structured by the Linux Foundation, the artifacts can be created and deployed via Jenkins.  The following maven targets are currently supported in the Build step:
```
clean install
javadoc:javadoc
sonar:sonar
```

### Build Instructions for external developers

This project is organized as a mvn project for a jar package.
After cloning from this git repo:

```
mvn clean install javadoc:javadoc
```

A description of the API is generated, and found in targets/generated-source/swagger.json.

### Properties File

This section is intended to describe the behavior customization of Bus Controller that can be obtained via properties file used by the dbcapi library.
By default, this file is located in etc/dmaapbc.properties.
However, a java argument -DConfigFile  can be set to a different path.  (Our kubernetes deployment relies on this and points to a configmap, for example.)

The table below lists all the settings, default values (if not set), and shows any explicit setting in ONAP oom kubernetes deployment.
